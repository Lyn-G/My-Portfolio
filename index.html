          My proudest accomplishment, despite still being a work in progress,
          has been this Unity game that I’ve been working on since December
          2023. As an assistant producer, I helped manage the timeline and track
          each team member’s progress. I checked in with different groups of
          people—artists, programmers, level designers, debuggers—to update
          Trello and let the production lead know of any issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          For UIX design and programming, I created and implemented the main
          menu, settings menu, and the cutscenes that play before it. This
          involved coding the scene transitions and sound design for seamless
          transitions. I also implemented multilingual support, integrating
          Chinese text into the game with plans to support additional languages.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my key contributions has been implementing a teleportation
          system that allows players to travel between different in-game
          locations based on if they collected the unlockables. I structured
          this using a dictionary ADT to efficiently manage unlocked
          teleportation points, ensuring that player progress is saved and
          carried over between scenes. Additionally, I developed the lore book
          feature, which tracks the player’s discoveries throughout the game.
          Players can navigate the book using keyboard or controller inputs to
          review previously unlocked entries. I used the same dictionary-based
          system and JSON serialization to enable auto-saving after collection
          so that all unlocked items are remembered across sessions.

        <h2>Snake</h2>

        <p>
          In this project, I developed an enhanced version of the classic Snake
          game, featuring both a player-controlled snake and an AI-controlled
          opponent. The unique twist lies in the shared growth mechanic:
          whenever the player collects food, the AI snake grows as well,
          progressively raising the difficulty. The AI dynamically tracks the
          player's position using a 2D coordinate system and plots a basic path
          toward the player’s head, simulating pursuit behavior in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          To implement this, I created a grid-based system to manage movement,
          food spawning, and collision detection. The AI uses the player's X and
          Y coordinates to calculate its direction each frame, adding strategic
          tension as the game progresses. This project allowed me to explore AI
          behavior modeling, game loop synchronization, and coordinate-based
          logic, while also sharpening my skills in debugging, modular design,
          and interactive gameplay development.

          During the brainstorming process, my team and I knew that we wanted to
          experiment with time-based elements. This caused us to think of
          creative gameplay mechanics such as seasons changing or geography
          altering due to erosion. Ultimately, it flourished into this
          idea—where the player controls an orb that reveals bits from the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          I largely handled conception and designing the visionaries that our
          team had. For scripting, I established the menus, scene transitions,
          and cutscenes. We used Unity to bring the game elements to life. I was
          the primary lead for managing the project timeline and setting
          milestones to ensure the game was released on time.

          In this game, players can plant different flowers to reach the goal of
          each stage. This game supports Hebrew, Chinese, and English. My
          primary task in this was to ensure code stayed optimized and clean.
          This was a daunting task as the difficulty in each new
          requirement—external and internal DSL, using a single continue byte
          array for memory, auto-save, offline mobile play— required various
          amounts of code in different sections. I participated in coding and
          researching new methods to program different parts where help was
          needed.
